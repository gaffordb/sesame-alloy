Approach
Demo 1
- Encrypt/Decrypt Using Public/Private Key
- run encrypt

- keypairs is always unique to the device record
- keypairs always consists of unique pairs of public_key and private key

checking if flawed in that we are simply following the specs,
there are extreme cases like Server faking the identity of the User and faking the sessions for specific devices to receive the message


present some signatures, show demo of encrypting/decrypting the text

Show Session


Reflection
- blindly focus on modeling the specification without fully understanding how the system works
    - ambiguity of the language 
        - User/User_Records
        - Device/Device_Records
        (ask for better specs <in real life>)
